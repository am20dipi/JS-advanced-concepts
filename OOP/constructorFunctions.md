# CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS

- The only way to add properties to an instance of an object is to use the 'this' keyword. 

- In order to use a constructor function, we need to use the 'new' keyword.

- The 'new' keyword automatically returns the object for us.
- The 'new' keyword creates the constructor, giving us access to the properties of the object.
- The 'new' keyword changes what 'this' points to; 'this' now points to the instance of the object we just created.

- Constructor functions create objects.
    - `var a = new Number(5)` => typeof a => object
