# OOP INTRODUCTION

The two main components of a program are the (1) data and the (2) behavior. 

We can organize data and behavior using languages. 

Scheme and Java inspired JavaScript. 

* Scheme => functions => Functional Programming

* Java => objects => Object-Oriented Programming

JavaScript uses both FP and OOP to create clear, concise code. 

## Functional Programming

FP says data and behavior are two distinctly different things: therefore, they should be kept separate for clarity. 

FP also says give me data and I will create something new and return that something new using functions.

Closures are an asset of FP.

## Object-Oriented Programming

OOP says bringing together the data and its behavior in a single location called an 'object' is easier to understand how our programs work. 

OOP has a series of components that work together to do something; each with its own functionality and behavior. Yet, everything is still built together. 

Prototypes/Prototypal Chain is an asset of OOP.
