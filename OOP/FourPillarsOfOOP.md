# FOUR (4) PILLARS OF OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## ENCAPSULATION

The idea of wrapping code into "boxes" that are related to each other. These boxes can use each other's properties and methods. This makes code easy to maintain, easy to read and less repetitive. 

The idea of keeping state and logic internal.

## ABSTRACTION

More general, less specific. 

Through abstraction JavaScript does complex things under the hood and behind the scenes. Abstraction shows less at face value what the code is doing so for us programmers we have to do less. 

Quite simply, abstraction is the concept of wrapping up complex actions in simple verbs. Describe each thing you’ve abstracted clearly, and hide the complexity. 

Example: 

The append and insert methods: 

Instead of calling keep_going_until_you_find_a node_that_is_nil_and_create_a_new_node_and_fill_it_with_this_data, we can call append or insert



## INHERITANCE


Classes can have parent classes. Child classes will inherit all of the behavior and attributes of the parent class. Child classes can then choose to overwrite some of those as necessary.

Why?

Code organization. Where does it make sense to keep things together, and where are responsibilities separate. Saving memory space; less repetitive code.


## POLYMORPHISM

The idea that if you call the same method on different objects the method (can) behave differently on each object. 

The ability for something to appear in many forms or result in different outputs. 

 If there’s a verb/method name that works for similar processes, just use that same name. Even if it doesn’t actually refer to the same thing happening.
