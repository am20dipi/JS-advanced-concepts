# INHERTIANCE

Passing knowledge down.

Inheritance links up the Prototype Chain to reduce repetitive code.

Inheritances links a sub class to the super class. 

A sub class inherits properties and methods of the super class. 

We use and call super() to point 'this' to the super class' constructor(). 


## OOP in REACT

Class components in React have to extend React.Component class (React's super class)!
