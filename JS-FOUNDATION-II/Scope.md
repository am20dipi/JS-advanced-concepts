# SCOPE

## VARIABLE ENVIRONMENT

A place where variables live in the execution context. 


## SCOPE CHAIN

Each context has a link to its parent's context. 

Each function has access to the global, lexical environment in which it is declared -- it does not matter where the function is invoked. 

Lexical Scope === Static Scope

Lexical Environment === [[scope]]
