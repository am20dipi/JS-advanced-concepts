# LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT

'Lexical'=> related to the words or vocabulary of a language. 

'Lexical Environment' => where you code/write something

A lexical environment is created every time an execution context is created. 

Lexical Analysis => checking to see where the code is written -- its location -- its scope.

### Execution context tells us which lexical enviroment is currently running. True or False?

* TRUE 


In JavaScript, our lexical environment AND lexical scope determines our available variables -- not where the function is called. 

* Function declaration determines scope not when the function is called.
