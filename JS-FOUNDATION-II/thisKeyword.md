# THIS

'this' is the object that the function is a property of. 

'this' is the object!

When the Global Execution Context is created, 'this' === the Global Object.

'this' changes based on the context in which it is called. 

'this' keyword is dynamically scoped; it does not matter where the object 'this' refers to is written; it matters where it is called. 

Arrow functions binds 'this' to the object.
