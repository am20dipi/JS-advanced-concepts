# Memory Heap

Place to store and write information and data. Place to allocate memory, use memory, and release memory. 

``` const number = 610 // --> please allocate memory for variable 'number' ``` 

* 'number' will be stored in a memory location in the memory heap. 

The Memory Heap provides a free store of memory to keep data in memory.

The Memory Heap allows us to use variables to point to where the data will be stored. 

The V8 Engine stores variables (and its data) in memory locations for us (think cubbies) -- we do not have to do anything.
