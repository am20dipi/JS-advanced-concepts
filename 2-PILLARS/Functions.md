# Functions

Functions in JavaScript are OBJECTS.

Invoking a function produces:
1. 'this' keyword
2. 'arguments' keyword

'arguments' is an array-like object that has some weird behavior -- therefore, we want to avoid using it. Instead, let's use the spread operator. 

When we define a function, a variable environment is created -- variables created within the function have function scope. 

* Arrow functions
* Function expressions
* Function declarations
* Declaring a function as a method on an object
* Function object constructor
* Anonymous functions

## Functions are First-Class Citizens

1. Functions can be passed in as an argument to another function. 

2. Functions can be assigned to properties of objects and variables.  

3. Return functions as values for other functions.
