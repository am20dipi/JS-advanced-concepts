# JavaScript Types

Types are the building blocks of a language.

* Numbers
* Strings
* Booleans
* Undefined
* Null
* Objects
* Symbols

JavaScript has an operator 'typeof' that tells us the type of a piece of data:

   * `typeof 5` =>  number
   * `typeof 'hello'` =>  string
   * `typeof [1, 2, 3]` =>  object
   * `typeof {}` =>  object

Languages can be Statically Typed or Dynamically Typed. 

Symbol value creates something unique; it is useful in individually identifying pieces of data. Usually used for object properties.


## Primitive Types

Primitive: data that represents only a single value.

* Numbers
* Strings
* Booleans
* Undefined
* Null
* Symbols

undefined => absence of variable definition; no 'return' keyword; missing properties of an object

null => absence of value



# Non-Primitive Types

Non-Primitive: does not contain the actual value directly. 

* Arrays
* Functions
* Objects

REMEMBER: arrays and functions are OBJECTS.
