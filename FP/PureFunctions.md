# PURE FUNCTIONS

* Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.

* Pure functions cannot modify anything outside of itself => no side effects. 

* Side effects can be destructive.
    * For example: a function that calls pop() on an array. 
    * The array is changed each time we call pop() so it both modifies the array and produces different output given the same input (the array).
