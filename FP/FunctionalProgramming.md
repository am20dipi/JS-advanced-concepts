# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

* Emphasis on simplicity where data and functions are concerned. 

* Functions operate on well-defined data structures rather than class inheritance (objects, data or functions belonging to an object).

## SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

* Separating code into chunks with each chunk has its own responsibilities. 

* Functional Programming separates data from functions. 


## PILLARS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

1. Pure Functions (immutability)
   - all functions created in FP are immutable (cannot be changed)
