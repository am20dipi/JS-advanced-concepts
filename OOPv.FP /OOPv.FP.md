# OOP v. FP

## FP

* many operations on fixed data.
* data is immutable.
* stateless => we do not modify state.
* pure functions => no side effects.
* avoiding side effects using pure functions. 
* creating copies of data as to not modify the original data. 
* declarative => describes what the code is doing.



## OOP

* few operations on common(related) data.
* stateful => we are modifying state. 
* 'this'
* 'self'
* side effects are plentiful
* constructors (creating instances from classes)
* imperative => describes how.
