# INHERITANCE v. COMPOSITION

## Inheritance

* Seen in class syntax of OOP. 
* Focuses on what the data is or related to. 
* Fragile Base Class Problem: a change in the super class has a rippling effect onto all of its sub classes because it can cause a lot of problems/bugs.
* Tight Coupling: how super related a child class is to its parent class. 
* Hierarchy Problem: When a sub class inherits all the properties and methods of its parent class when it doesn't really need any of that.
* Updates to a program/application may have to result in major changes in the hierarchy but the tight coupling makes that difficult.  



## Composition

* Seen in functional programming.
* Focuses on what the data is and what it has. 
* Smaller pieces that are combined to create the desired output. 
* Avoiding side effects by writing pure functions
